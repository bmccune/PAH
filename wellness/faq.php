		<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
		<br /><br />
		<span class="faq-q">Q: What is the difference between wellness plans and pet insurance?</span>
		<span class="faq-a">A: Pet insurance covers specified injuries or illness up to a predetermined amount by the insurance provider. Insurance follows your pet no matter which veterinary practice you decide to use.  Wellness plans are intended to provide all necessary preventive care depending on life stage. Wellness plan services and medical care discounts are only available at this location. Unlike insurance pre-existing conditions do not affect annual fees or package exclusions.</span>

		<span class="faq-q">Q: Is there a discount if I want to enroll more than one pet?</span>
		<span class="faq-a">A: Yes, each additional pet enrolled receives a discount.</span>

		<span class="faq-q">Q: What if my pet gets sick and they are on the plan?</span>
		<span class="faq-a">A: Wellness plans are services provided to prevent illness and catch it early.  Any unpredictable or abnormal issues (e.g. retained baby teeth, umbilical hernias, vaccine reactions, illness, etc...) are not included, but treatment for these are discounted, and your office visit is always free.</span>

		<span class="faq-q">Q: Is a wellness plan right for my pet?</span>
		<span class="faq-a">A: Annual wellness plans are a cost-effective and convenient way to provide the best preventive care available. As a pet parent you can be assured your pets will receive everything they need without having to choose from a menu of services. While enrolled, your pet will receive an additional 5-15% discount on medical products and services, along with no charge examinations.</span>

		<span class="faq-q">Q: Can I transfer my services between my pets?</span>
		<span class="faq-a">A: Plans are not transferable form pet to pet or between owners.</span>

		<span class="faq-q">Q: What if I want to cancel?</span>
		<span class="faq-a">A:  When signing on a plan, you are signing a one-year agreement.  These automatically will re-enroll annually (puppies will be upgraded to the adult maintenance care plan) until, and/or if, you advise that you want to cancel.  Plan services are given at a heavily discounted rate.  If you do decide you want to cancel before the term, the client is responsible for the remaining payments on the plan for the remainder of the year or the full retail value for the services and discounts used by the pet (whichever is less).</span>

		<span class="faq-q">Q: How are automatic monthly payments handled?</span>
		<span class="faq-a">A: We will collect directly from your active checking or savings account on the date you specify in the contract. More information can be obtained at the hospital. Remember you can also pay the entire year at the time of enrollment.</span>
